# Kubernetes Colearning

This is the notes and progress from our unstructured colearning sessions
to learn Kubernetes well enough to certify for the CKA and CKAD (not
necessarily in that order). They are recorded live on [Twitch] and saved
to [YouTube]. Many of my conclusions are captured in my [Zettelkasten
repo][zet].

## Primary Resources

Only the following resources are allowed on the certification exams.
Therefore, these are the primary resources to read and even memorize
when creating your own learning lab scenarios.

* <https://kubernetes.io/docs>
* <https://kubernetes.io/blog>
* <https://github.com/kubernetes>

## Zettel Casts

These are the relevant videos (under 10 minutes each) in no particular
order. I've been adding them to the list at the end when I make a
discovery or conclusion, or change in direction, so probably best to
watch in order if you are inclined.

## Comments from Those Who Have Taken Cert Exams

> "I failed my CKA exam. I got a question that was not in the 200 dollar
> training on the CNCF site. Failed 2 times and that same problem issue
> question killed me and was 8 points."
