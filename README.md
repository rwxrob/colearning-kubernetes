# Kubernetes Colearning

This is the notes and progress from our unstructured colearning sessions
to learn Kubernetes well enough to certify for the CKA and CKAD (not
necessarily in that order). They are recorded live on [Twitch] and saved
to [YouTube]. Much of my conclusions are captured in my [Zettelkasten
repo][zet].
